# About TheKnowDough

TheKnowDough is an ever-evolving inter-disciplinary practice than channels visions through algorithmic processes to solve, explore and produce manifestations of complexity.
Founded by Boyan Mihaylov, it is a holistic fusion of trajectories through product design, computational science, architecture, generative visuals and music.

TheKnowDough unites these fields under common creative philosophy and ethics:
- **A focus on creating processes rather than static objects.** Procedural design (creating your own instructions) enhances exploration compared to explicit crafting (following pre-defined instructions). Similarly, a product is never in a "finished" state, but is subject to ongoing environmental changes.
- **Technology should aid curiosity, not stifle it.** Advanced computation is only valuable to human knowledge as long as it is an extension of human thinking, inspires exploration and allows critical dissection through tangible underlying processes.
- **Technology should aid a better world, not serve itself.** Whether through advancing knowledge for mindful control of complex systems, or by subjecting itself to a responsible use of resources, computation should be an instrument for improving natural, not artificial, ecosystems.

> Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them. (Frank Herbert, _Dune_, 1965)
