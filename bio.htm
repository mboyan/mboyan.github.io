    <i>TheKnowDough</i> was founded in Amsterdam in 2023 by me, <b>Boyan Mihaylov</b>.
    It weaves together previous paths of research and creation into a shape-shifting body of expertise.

    I have always been interested in <b>worldbuilding</b> - the construction of speculative mirrors of our universe, shaped by coherent laws and relationships as the backdrop of intriguing stories.
</p>
<p>
    My journey began in <b>architecture</b> - where worlds are built in the form of habitable space, reflecting social and existential necessities through the language of material and structure.
</p>
<p>
    The revelation soon came that worlds can emerge <b>algorithmically</b> - fueled by stories told through mathematics.
    I discovered the common ground of <b>design and programming</b> during the early years of the Institute for Computational Design (ICD) at the University of Stuttgart, where <b>biomimetics</b> is commonly used as an inspiration tool for design and engineering.
    Through a close involvement in digitally fabricated medium-scale architecture projects, I entered the world of robotic and CNC fabrication and became familiar with mass customisation techniques.
</p>
<p>
    It was during that time that I engaged with the Baubotanik Research Group, who envision a world in which human-made architecture and living plants symbiotically intertwine as biomechanical hybrids.
    For the first time I was confronted with the problem of <b>modelling biological systems</b>, in an attempt to construct simulation tools for the growth of living tree structures.
</p>
<p>
    The technical computational design expertise could soon be shared during my role as a <b>tutor</b> at courses organised by DesignMorphine and CEDIM. So others could learn to shape their physical and digital worlds.
</p>
<p>
    During my years as a <b>computational design specialist</b> at Joris Laarman Studio in Amsterdam, I refined the ability to interpret abstract conceptual ideas as precise geometric and algorithmic logic.
    This resulted in many fascinating projects, ranging from product design and small-scale architecture to augmented reality workflows.
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, my involvement in a DIY movement linked to the vibrant electronic music scene of Amsterdam led to various <b>interactive installation</b> projects, <b>creative coding</b> for party visuals and <b>live-coding</b> jams.
    My participation in organising electronic music events culminated in the co-founding of <b>WP Frequencies</b>, an international collective of DJs and visual artists. I have also been performing as a DJ under the alias <b>fin</b>.
</p>
<p>
    I pursued my second degree in <b>computational science</b> at the University of Amsterdam.
    My understanding of algorithms as building speculative worlds found a new application.
    Delving into a plethora of scientific disciplines, all linked by the common platform of computation, I studies models of phenomena occurring in our own world.
    This included exercises in complex systems, self-organisation and pattern formation - molecular, biological and societal.
    For my graduation project, I explored the <b>diffusion-based signalling mechanisms</b> of mould spores by assessing different models of their interaction.

    <i>TheKnowDough</i> marks my entry as an <b>independent interdisciplinary professional</b>, conceived as a shape-shifting entity that unites these paths of creation and research.
    Notable projects that have come to fruition under this endeavour are <b>The Underground Tree</b> in colaboration with Tanja Smeets and <b>Diploria Lighting</b> in colaboration with Michael Jasinski.
