    I have always been interested in <b>worldbuilding</b> - the construction of speculative mirrors of our universe, shaped by coherent laws and relationships as the backdrop of intriguing stories.
</p>
<p>
    My journey began in <b>Architecture</b> - where worlds are built in the form of habitable space, reflecting social and existential necessities through the language of material and structure.
</p>
<p>
    I discovered the intersection between <b>design and programming</b> during the early years of the Institute for Computational Design at the University of Stuttgart.
    Through a close involvement in digitally fabricated medium-scale architectural and design projects, I entered the world of robotic and CNC fabrication and became familiar with mass customisation techniques.
