                <i>TheKnowDough</i> is an ever-evolving interdisciplinary practice that channels <b>visions</b> through <b>algorithmic processes</b> to solve, explore and produce <b>manifestations of complexity</b>.
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Founded by Boyan Mihaylov in Amsterdam, <i>TheKnowDough</i> fuses ventures in product design, computational science, architecture, generative visuals and music.

                <b>Nature carries an inherent capacity to compute.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The work of <i>TheKnowDough</i> is driven by a fascination with the emergence found in biological, chemical and physical systems. This serves both as an inspiration - translating natural principles to algorithm, form and function - and as an object of study - using computational modelling to understand nature better.

            <p><b>Creative philosophy and ethics</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><b>A focus on creating processes rather than static objects.</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Our universe is <b>dynamic</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    A product is <b>never in a finished state</b>, but is subject to ongoing environmental changes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Procedural design</b> (creating instructions) enhances exploration compared to <b>explicit crafting</b> (creating objects).</li>
                    
                <li><b>Technology should aid, not stifle, curiosity.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Computational tools are only valuable for human knowledge as long as they are an <b>extension of human reasoning</b>, inspire <b>exploration</b> and allow <b>critical dissection</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    Black boxes and obfuscationism are counterproductive.</li>
                    <blockquote><i>Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <div style="text-align:right">(Frank Herbert, <i>Dune</i>, 1965)</style></blockquote>
                <li><b>Technology should serve a better world instead of itself.</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Whether by advancing knowledge for the <b>mindful management of complex systems</b>, or by succumbing to a <b>responsible use of resources</b>, computation should ultimately improve natural ecosystems.</li>
