                        Founded by Boyan Mihaylov in Amsterdam, <i>TheKnowDough</i> fuses ventures in product design, computational science, architecture, generative visuals and music.

                    <p>These fields are united under common <font color="#0d7c82"><b>creative philosophy and ethics</b></font>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>A focus on creating processes rather than static objects.</b><br>
                            <font color="#0d7c82"><b>Procedural design</b></font> (creating instructions) enhances exploration compared to <font color="#0d7c82"><b>explicit crafting</b></font> (following pre-defined instructions). A product is <font color="#0d7c82"><b>never in a finished state</b></font>, but is subject to ongoing environmental changes.</li>
                        <li><b>Technology should aid curiosity, not stifle it.</b><br>
                            Computation tools are only valuable to human knowledge as long as they are an <font color="#0d7c82"><b>extension of human reasoning</b></font>, inspire <font color="#0d7c82"><b>exploration</b></font> and allow <font color="#0d7c82"><b>critical dissection</b></font>.</li>
                        <li><b>Technology should aid a better world, not serve itself.</b><br>
                            Whether by advancing knowledge for <font color="#0d7c82"><b>mindful management of complex systems</b></font>, or by subjecting itself to a <font color="#0d7c82"><b>responsible use of resources</b></font>, computation should be an instrument for improving natural, not artificial, ecosystems.</li>

                        <font color="#0d7c82"><b>Nature carries an inherent capacity to compute.</b></font> The work of <i>TheKnowDough</i> is driven by a fascination with the natural intelligence found in biological, chemical and physical systems. This serves both as an inspiration (translating natural principles to form and function) and as an object of study (applying computational modelling to understand nature better).
