                    <p>These fields are united under common <font color="#0d7c82"><b>creative philosophy and ethics</b></font>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>A focus on creating processes rather than static objects.</b><br>
                            <br>
                            Our universe is <font color="#0d7c82"><b>dynamic</b></font>.
                            <br><br>
                            A product is <font color="#0d7c82"><b>never in a finished state</b></font>, but is subject to ongoing environmental changes.
                            <br><br>
                            <font color="#0d7c82"><b>Procedural design</b></font> (creating instructions) enhances exploration compared to <font color="#0d7c82"><b>explicit crafting</b></font> (creating objects).</li>
                            
                        <li><b>Technology should aid, not stifle, curiosity.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            Computation tools are only valuable for human knowledge as long as they are an <font color="#0d7c82"><b>extension of human reasoning</b></font>, inspire <font color="#0d7c82"><b>exploration</b></font> and allow <font color="#0d7c82"><b>critical dissection</b></font>.
                            <br><br>
                            Black boxes and obfuscationism are counterproductive.</li>

                            Whether by advancing knowledge for <font color="#0d7c82"><b>mindful management of complex systems</b></font>, or by succumbing to a <font color="#0d7c82"><b>responsible use of resources</b></font>, computation should ultimately improve natural ecosystems.</li>

                        The work of <i>TheKnowDough</i> is driven by a fascination with the emergence found in biological, chemical and physical systems. This serves both as an inspiration - translating natural principles to algorithm, form and function - and as an object of study - using computational modelling to understand nature better.
